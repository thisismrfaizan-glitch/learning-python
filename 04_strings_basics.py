#introductionto strings
#strings are the value that store text data in double quotes,singlequotes or triple quotes in python programming language
#strings are immutable
#examples
a = "hello " 
b = 'faizan shaikh'
C = '''this is a string with triple quotes. it can also used to write multi-line strings.'''

#strings can be concatenated using the + operator (concatenation means joining two different strings together)

d = a + b
print(d)
# we can use the following opperators with strings for their operations
# + for concatenation
# * for multiplication (repeating the string)

e= int(input("enter a number: "))
f= int(input("enter the second number: "))
result = e * f
print(result)


g= (input("enter a number: "))
h= (input("enter the second number: "))
print(g + h)
