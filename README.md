Python Learning Journey 🚀

Hey there!  
I'm Faizan — currently pursuing a Diploma in Pharmacy, but I've chosen to take a bold detour.  
This repo is my open journal of switching from **pharma to tech**, where I'm learning Python step-by-step to break into the world of **AI and Machine Learning**.

No shortcuts. No fluff. Just proof of daily effort and real learning.

Why I’m Doing This

I didn’t come from a computer background. No math in 12th, no tech exposure.  
But I’ve made up my mind: I want to build things that matter. I want a career that gives me freedom, and I want to prove that even a non-tech guy can crack it in the world of AI/ML.

This repo is more than just code — it’s a signal to myself and the world that I’m serious.  
One commit at a time, one line of code at a time — I’m building the foundation for a new life.

📅 My Learning Log

| Day | Topics Covered |
|-----|----------------|
| Day 1 | Hello World, Print, Strings, Terminal Basics |
| Day 2 | String Operations, Slicing, String Functions |
| Day 3 | Code practice & repetition – string revisions |
| Day 4 | Coming next: Conditions & Loops |

More updates coming every day. This is just the beginning.

🎯 The Bigger Goal

- 🔁 Shift from non-tech to a **career in AI/ML**
- 📚 Build real projects, not just tutorials
- 💼 Become job-ready in 12–15 months (while doing BCA)
- 💸 Earn through my skills in the next 6–9 months
- 🧠 Prove to myself that I can learn anything I commit to
