# Python Learning Journey 🚀

👋 Welcome to my journey of learning Python from scratch.  
This repository will track my daily progress, starting from the basics to advanced AI/ML concepts.


## 🧠 Why I'm Doing This

I come from a non-tech background with a Diploma in Pharmacy, but I’ve made a bold decision to shift into the world of tech — specifically AI and Machine Learning.

I’m not just learning Python to write code — I’m learning it to build a **future-proof career**, to prove that **background doesn’t limit potential**, and to become someone who creates real-world impact using technology.

This repository is my **digital proof of consistency, courage, and growth.**  
It’s the foundation of my future as an AI/ML engineer — one commit at a time.
