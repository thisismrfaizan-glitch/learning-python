# Python Learning Journey 🚀 

Hey, I’m Faizan — moving from Pharma to AI/ML, one line of code at a time.  
This repo tracks my daily progress, projects, and mindset.

## ​ Goals

- 📘 Master Python fundamentals and intermediate skills

## ​ Why This Journey Matters

I don't come from a tech background — no math after 10th, yet I'm proving that consistency and purpose can build a new future.  
This repo is my public record: growth, grit, and real skills.
