#there are many string function in python that can be used to manipulate strings
#ihave learnt some of them and i will share them below
#string function
#1) len(string) - this function is used to find the length of the string 

a = "hello world "
print(len(a)) #output would be 12 because it counts the space as well

#2) string.capitalize() - this function is used to capitalize the first letter of the string
b = " hello faizan"
print(b.capitalize)
